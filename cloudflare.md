# Slider (Beta)

The Slider is an innovative ad unit that allows any publisher to generate incremental revenue with little effort. It is complementary to existing ad units, can be enabled with a single click and is available exclusively to CloudFlare publishers (subject to approval).  The Slider also includes numerous configuration options that allow you to control the level of interaction with your site’s visitors.

## Features


**Generate Incremental revenue with minimal effort.**  The Slider—an IAB standard 300x250 medium rectangle—elegantly slides onto the page after one second of visitor engagement drawing visitor attention and generating engagement rates several times that of similar native ad units. The end result is higher yield and more revenue for publishers. 


**Access to Top Advertisers.**  Get instantaneous access to many of the world’s largest marketplaces for advertisers. No matter how small or large, or broad or niche your website is—we have advertisers appropriate for your content.


**Yield Optimization.**   Our advertiser partners compete in real-time within our ad decisioning engine to ensure that your inventory captures substantial demand at the highest possible yield. Multiple relevant advertisers participate in real-time auctions to deliver the highest paying ads for every single impression.


    Note: the Slider will not appear on pages viewed on mobile browsers


## How It Works

1.  Enable the Slider within the CloudFlare Apps Manager

2.  Configure when and where the Slider appears. You have complete control over:

    a.  **Orientation:** position the Slider on the top left or right, bottom left or right, or you may also choose to display the Slider only when a visitor reaches the end of your content.

    b.  **Format:** choose between static ads (images and flash), and static and video ads.  Video ads tend to pay more, but don’t suit every site.  

    c.  **Duration of Appearance:** you can choose to minimize the Slider after a predetermined period of time after it appears.  Choose between 20, 30 or 45 seconds, or select “Do not minimize” if you would like the Slider to remain fully visible on the page.  

    d.  **Minimum Window Size:** Limit display of the Slider to certain window sizes.  This option can be used to prevent the slider from covering your site’s content when viewed at low window resolutions. Do note that the Slider will not appear  on pages viewed by a mobile browser

    e.  **Scrollability:** Turn Sticky Scroll “on” to allow the Slider to scroll with your content

    f.  **Impressions per Session:** Limit the number of ads shown to your visitors during a single session / site visit (20 minutes).

    g.  **Visitor Opt-out Periods:** After a visitor closes the Slider (by clicking the X close icon), you can toggle the period of time to wait before showing another ad.    

3.  The Slider works instantly!   You will start to earn incremental revenue immediately.  


## Restrictions

The Slider is open to all CloudFlare publishers subject to approval.  We reserve the right to deny approval or remove the Slider from any site with content that, in our belief, may be deemed negative in nature, illegal or offensive in any way.  


## Payments

Earnings are available to publishers on a net-60 day basis.  For example, earnings accrued in March are available for payout at the end of May, subject to minimum payout thresholds (varies by payment method).
